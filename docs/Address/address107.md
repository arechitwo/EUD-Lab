# Description

Purpose<br><br><br>To detect the hotkey and then the slot that a unit is stored in and/or the unit<br><br>that is stored in a slot within a hotkey for any player.<br><br><br>Math<br><br><br>The total amount of units that can be hotkeyed<br>is 12.<br><br>There are 9 hotkeys in existence.<br><br>12 * 9 = 108<br><br>108 is the total amount of EPD values for each<br>player.<br><br>	If we want to check if there's a unit in the<br>	seventh slot within the hotkey CTRL+0 for<br>	Player 1,<br><br>	-10561 + 7 = -10555.<br><br>	If we want to check if there's a unit in the<br>	first slot within the hotkey CTRL+1 for Player<br>	1,<br><br>	-10561 + 12 = -10550.<br><br>	If we want to check if there's a unit in<br>	the first slot within the hotkey CTRL+0 for<br>	Player 2,<br><br>	-10561 + 109 = -10452.<br><br>12 * 9 * 8 = 864<br><br>864 is the total combined number of all players' EPD<br>value.<br><br>	We can check any slots within any hotkeys for<br>	any player to detect if any unit exist.<br><br>		At least 1<br><br>	We can check any slots within any hotkeys for<br>	any player to detect if no unit exist.<br><br>		At least 3749<br><br>	but what if we want to detect if a specific unit<br>	within the map is hotkeyed in a certain slot?<br><br>Unit alpha ID (Unit Entity)<br><br>Index #        Alpha ID<br>0	       2049<br>1	       3748 [+1700]<br>2	       3747 [-1]<br>3	       3746 [-1]<br><br>Confused? Hint: http://www.staredit.net/topic/14226/ (Read Section 6)<br><br>^^^^^^^Parts of this seem to be wrong.<br><br>This is the magic formula:<br>with the variables<br><br>p = player number (starting at 0 up to 7)<br>h = hotkey number<br>i = index in a hotkey (starting at 0 up to 11)<br>u = unit id<br><br>then if player p has unit u hotkeyed in index i of hotkey h, we have, for u > 0<br>memory(-10561+(p*216)+(h*12)+i) == 3749 - u,<br>and for u = 0,<br>memory(-10561+(p*216)+(h*12)+i) == 2049.<br><br>==============<br>Edited by PereC, 2021.06.25:<br>Each u32 stores the Alpha ID of a hotkeyed unit:<br>Starting from 0x57FE60: All the hotkeyed unit of P1<br>0x57FE60: Alpha ID of the 1st unit in P1 hotkey 0<br>0x57FE64: Alpha ID of the 2nd unit in P1 hotkey 0<br>0x57FE68: Alpha ID of the 3rd unit in P1 hotkey 0<br>...<br>0x57FE60 + 4 * 11: Alpha ID of the 12th unit in P1 hotkey 0<br>0x57FE60 + 4 * 12: Alpha ID of the 1st unit in P1 hotkey 1<br>0x57FE60 + 4 * 13: Alpha ID of the 2nd unit in P1 hotkey 1<br>...<br>0x57FE60 + 4 * 119: Alpha ID of the 12th unit in P1 hotkey 9<br>From 0x57FE60 + 4 * 120 to 0x57FE60 + 4 * 216: ??????<br>-----------<br>Starting from 0x57FE60 + 216: All the hotkeyed unit of P2<br>-----------<br>Starting from 0x57FE60 + 216 * 2: All the hotkeyed unit of P3<br>-----------<br>...<br>-----------<br>Starting from 0x57FE60 + 216 * 7: All the hotkeyed unit of P8<br>-----------<br><br>Personally I don't know why there are 864 bytes for each player. Intuitively there should be 4 * 12 * 10 = 480 bytes for each player, cuz there are 10 hotkeys and 12 units within a hotkey.
