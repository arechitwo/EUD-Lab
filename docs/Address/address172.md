Look at the X pixel placement of P3 start location in your map editor and<br>write it down.<br><br>3. Look at the Y pixel placement of P3 start location in your map editor<br>and write it down.<br><br>4. Now plug those numbers into this formula:<br>Memory at Death Table + 3312 is exactly (3145792 + (((Start Location X * 16777216) + (Start Location Y * 256)) * 256) + (4194352 * 65536) + (805322752 * 16777216))<br><br>3145792, 4194352, and 805322752 are "constants," that you need to know and account for in the equation. Because EPD reads 4 bytes at once (this formula does not work for Player 1 and Player 2 Start Location. If you understood everything that was said so far, then coming up with another formula that's specific to those two will be easy).<br><br>5. The trigger should work, and if it doesn't, then either you have miscalculated or these "unknowns", are not constant.<br><br>Challenge - Find out what those unknowns are actually for, and/or create an easier formula than the one I have come up with.
